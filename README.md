# Mimicker
 A game that I have created on GDevelop
 
 

# Compiling and running the game:
 
 To compile the game you need:
 - Yarn
 - Electron Builder
 
 
# How to compile:[](url)
 
 Go to the project folder in Command Prompt or any other shell
 
 Then type:
 ```
 yarn && yarn build
 ```
 
 Then when that is done you need to build it for the os you are on:
 ```
 # For Windows:
 yarn build -w
 # For Mac:
 yarn build -m
 # For Linux:
 yarn build -l
 ```
